# DirectX 11 c++ Engine
The purpose of this project was for me to learn more about DirectX and computer graphics in general.

Implementation:
- Windows application implemented with the WINAPI interface
- The graphics pipeline is done with the DirectX 11 library
- GUI is implemented with the [ImGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) library
